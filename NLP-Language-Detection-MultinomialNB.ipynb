       " '   in ancient philosophy  natura is mostly used as the latin translation of the greek word physis  φύσις   which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants  animals  and other features of the world develop of their own accord ',\n",
       " '     \\nthe concept of nature as a whole  the physical universe  is one of several expansions of the original notion    it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by pre socratic philosophers  though this word had a dynamic dimension then  especially for heraclitus   and has steadily gained currency ever since ',\n",
