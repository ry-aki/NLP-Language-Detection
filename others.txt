 Drawbacks of various classifier algorithms

 Naive Bayes
 1.Based in the assumption that the features have same statistical relevance and are independent, which is rarely true in real life.
 2.It assigns zero probability to a categorical variable whose category wasn’t available in the training dataset but is present in the test data      set.
  
 Logistic Regression
 1.Logistic Regression may lead to overfitting if the number of observations is lesser than the number of features.
 2.Logistic Regression is based on the assumption of linearity between the dependent variable and the independent variables.
 3.By using Logistic Regression, non-linear problems can't be solved because it has a linear decision surface.
 
 KNN Classifier
 1.It is quite difficult to pick the correct or most accurate value of K.
 2.In large datasets, the cost of calculating the distance between the new point and each existing points is huge which degrades the performance      of the algorithm.
 
 Decision Tree
 1.Decision tree often involves higher time to train the model.
 2.It can’t be used in big data as if the size of data is too big, then one single tree may grow a lot of nodes which might result in complexity      and leads to overfitting.
 
 Random Forest
 1.It is slower than other machine learning models. A large number of trees can make the algorithm too slow and ineffective for real-time              predictions. In general, these algorithms are fast to train, but quite slow to create predictions once they are trained.
 2.If data has categorical variables with different levels of attributes this can be a big problem because random forest algorithm will favor          those with more values which can pose a prediction risk.
 
 Support Vector Machine
 1.SVM algorithm is not suitable for large data sets.
 2.As the support vector classifier works by putting data points, above and below the classifying hyperplane there is no probabilistic                  explanation for the classification.

 Best algorithm to for language detection..
 
 To create a simple language detection model in Python using a Multinomial Naive Bayes model seems to be an appropriate choice as it has got an   accuracy of nearly 98% which is comparatively higher than other algorithms yields. 
 Also, as per the classification report, the class precision of almost all the classes are more than 95% and 100% in most cases.
 
 MultinomialNB calculates the probability of each class for a given sample and then gives the output of the class with highest probability.
 It is easy to implement as it only has to calculate probability. It is also highly scalable and can easily handle large datasets.

 Advantages of Language Detection
 
 In Natural Language Processing (NLP), one may need to work with data sets that contain documents in various languages. Many NLP algorithms only work with specific languages because the training data is usually in a single language. It can be a valuable time saver to determine which language your data set is in before running more algorithms on it. Here, language detection is used.
 
 Also, spam filtering services that support multiple languages must identify the language that emails, online comments, and other input are written in before applying true spam filtering algorithms. Without such detection, content originating from specific countries, regions, or areas suspected of generating spam cannot be adequately eliminated from online platforms.
 
 Language detection is thus used in many real life applications.
